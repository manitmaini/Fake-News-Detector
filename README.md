# Fake-News-Detector
News tweets that report what is happening have become an important real-time information source. Incidents happening in different corners of the globe are first reported by individuals on the ground than the media houses. This is where the issue arises. We cannot be sure how many of these tweets are true and how many are fake. This project proposes to use Semantic Role Labelling (SRL) to help classify and categorize tweets based on whether they are true or not. A domain specific SRL system will be trained with a supervised learning approach to resolve the problem.
